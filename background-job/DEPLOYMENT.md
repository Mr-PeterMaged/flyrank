# Background Report Jobs: deployment

## Vercel settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Root Directory | `background-job` |
| Framework Preset | Other |
| Node.js | 24.x |
| Install Command | `node --version` (backend dependencies are not needed for static assets) |
| Build Command | `node scripts/build-vercel.mjs` |
| Output Directory | Leave unset; the build emits Build Output API v3 |
| Entry page | `/` |

Set `BACKEND_ORIGIN=https://your-backend-host.example` in Vercel for each environment. Replace this example with a real reachable backend. Use an HTTPS origin without a trailing slash or path. Never point it at this Vercel frontend. Redeploy after changes.

The build publishes only web assets selected in `deployment.json`. Source code, environment files, databases and notebooks are excluded. Files are served first; remaining paths are forwarded to the backend when configured. API requests stay on the frontend origin. Keep private responses uncacheable and session cookies host-only (no backend-domain cookie attribute).

## Backend setup

Run npm ci and npm start in one persistent Node.js process. Configure Inngest event/signing keys and register the backend /api/inngest endpoint. Report state is process-local and lost on restart; durable application-state storage is required for business-critical use. Do not enable multiple replicas. Protect endpoints before public use.

## Build and verification

Run `node scripts/build-vercel.mjs` with the environment above. For a clean rebuild remove only generated `.vercel/output` first. Missing or malformed backend configuration fails the build. A successful build verifies packaging, not remote backend availability.

Existing checks: `node --check src/index.js`. After deployment, check desktop/mobile layout and the developer link, then exercise the real application workflow. Verify health, authentication, writes and logout where applicable. Configure the backend before expecting application data or jobs to work.
